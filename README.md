# Language Detection Models Comparison

This project compares the effectiveness of three language detection models: a statistical model based on n-grams, a basic model using bag-of-words with trigrams, and an LSTM-based model. Developed in Python, the project leverages scikit-learn, TensorFlow, pandas, and Keras for implementation.

Models can detect following languages: German (deu), English (eng), Spanish (spa), French (fra), Polish (pol), Portuguese (por), Dutch (nld)

## Tools and libraries used:
- `scikit-learn`: Provides functions for model creation, training, and vectorization.
- `Tensorflow`: Enables deep learning and neural network operations.
- `DataFrame`: Organizes and flexibly uses data.
- `pandas`: Assists in data manipulation.
- `keras`: Facilitates sequential processing.
- `matplotlib`: Aids in creating performance charts.
